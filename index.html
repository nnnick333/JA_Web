    <article>
     <p>	(SAMPLE CONTENT)Who is involved:
         Discusses the benefits of globalization and its versatility. The article brings up Elon Musk’s name, using him as an example of what globalization can achieve. The article takes a look at globalization through the lens of five entrepreneurs: Lathan Fritz, Guy Weitzman, John Bates, Michael Hadley and James  G. Wetrich. The article itself is quite long so I will only focus on 3 of the five entrepreneurs mentioned, these being: John Bates the Ceo and Founder of Executive Speaking Success , Michael Hadley the Ceo and President of iCorps Technology and James G Wetrich the CEO of the Wetrich Group.

         What happened:
         The writer of the article begins by speaking of the bounds of globalization mentioning the actions of Elon Musk as he attempted to save the boys trapped in Thailand. John Bates Bates gives expert advice on leadership communication on a global scale. Globalization has made English the standard language of the business world and thus has allowed him and his company to reach a much larger audience than just America and other primarily English speaking countries. Michael Hadley states that technology is at the forefront of globalization and is a sector that needs globalization. He believes that now is a better time than ever for IT inventors. He points out that globalization has driven competition between global companies to a global scale, and only the most innovative and driven companies will survive in this rapidly advancing. He also mentions the benefit of rapid technological advances as knowledge and innovations in the technological world are now reaching a global scale. James G. Wetrich who works in the medical industry. He believes that many locations in the world are in need of solution and cures to problems and diseases that exist in our world. He believes with the rapid travel of technology on a global scale the whole world would benefit from discovery of one country.

         Where did it take place:
         For the most part the article speaks generally about the location. The article mainly focuses on North America(as the entrepreneurs mentioned in the article operate in America), and refers to the rest of the world generally. However, the article does specifically mention that Elon Musk was able to demonstrate the extent of globalization when he attempted to save the trapped soccer players in Thailand. This shows that the benefits of globalization were able to reach from America all the way to Thailand.

         When did it occur:
         The article talks about the benefits of globalization within a very recent time frame. An example would be the article’s mention of Elon Musk making an attempt to save the boys in Thailand.
